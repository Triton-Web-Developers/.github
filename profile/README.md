Triton Web Dev builds websites for other UCSD clubs. A main issue we've seen with clubs at UCSD is that Engineering clubs usually have websites because they have members who can build them, while non-Engineering clubs usually don't have websites because none of their members know how to. Meanwhile, there are probably many students at UCSD who want to do webÂ development. Triton Web Dev aims to connect these students with these clubs, and eventually provide an outlet for any student interested in developing software.
